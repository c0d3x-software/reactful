# Props binding

## Abstract

React is the most popular frontend library, but it has one of the most complex, verbose and error phrone design to handle states as a component-based single page application technology, far beyond of their more important competitor in this aspect: Angular framework, that uses two-way data binding approach, but, this approach cost performance. This resarch creates a two-way data binding within a React one-way data flow architecture without performance losses, using javascript proxy objects to encapsulate the state management algorithmm. As results, all boilerplate code for React state management was erased, achieving a two-way data binding design within a one-way data binding architecture, without performance cost.
