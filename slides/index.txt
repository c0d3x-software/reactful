Hi, I will present the Reactful framework, an innovative approach to dealing with the core issues in the React development experience.

----

The main React development flaws are its state management complexity, followed by the scopeless CSS, and the lack of a function metadata.

---

CSS imports leaks is not solved by popular CSS-module and styled-component libs.

React state management verbosity and complexity scales in geometric progression.

The lack of functional metadata overloads the framework design with file naming conventions, and limmited semantics with use directives for functional scope.

---

Reactful intruduces five new concepts into React ecosystem to deal with those issues.

Reactful solves the modular CSS issues with its loader CSS transpiler. 

Its function decorators solves the lack of function metadata.

Reactive objects allows self-rendering states for local states props, and injectable global states.

Attribute directives intruduces smart injectable props by dependency injection.

Reactiful IoC containers use the component's second argument for dependency injection.

---

Reactful Framework is also a full-featured React framework.

Its support static and nested directory routing, and dynamic routes with decorators.

Its modular CSS has also component-scoped CSS, style props and classless CSS default.

Reactful server supports markdown, API folder, SEO, CSR, SSR, SSG and ISR.

The already mentioned stateful local props and global stores, has also modular states.

Controlled and uncontrolled components data and bind directives for props, form, and action bindings.

So, that's it. The Reactful framework is still in alpha test, but we looking for design feedback from the dev community. Let your thoughts be in the comments. Thank you for watching!
